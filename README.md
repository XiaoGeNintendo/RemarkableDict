# RemarkableDict
 Simple self-use dictionary for Remarkable

This is a very simple dictionary(mostly for Asain languages) for Remarkable.


# Environment
This program has been tested on Remarkable 1 OS version 2.14.3.977 with Remux as launcher and toltec installed.

# Install
**Warning: This project is 0% production-ready and by no means up to industrial standard. Please be sure to read & modify the code to meet your own needs before use!**

1. Install [Carta](https://github.com/Jayy001/Carta) on Remarkble.

2. Download and copy the whole repo to your remarkable `/home/root/apps` (you can ignore the `process` folder as they are scripts for generating the dictionaries).

3. Register `example.py` as application by using `chmod +x`. Refer to the guide of the launcher you are using for more.

4. Install a font(like noto) at `/usr/share/fonts/ttf/chnfont.otf` to support Asian languages.

5. Run the program and search!

# Dictionaries
I do not own any of the dictionaries. So here are their sources:

- Chinese Idiom: [xinhua](https://github.com/pwxcoo/chinese-xinhua)
- Chinese Words: [MDBG](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary)
